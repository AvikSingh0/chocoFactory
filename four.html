        <t3>    <p>The Choco Factory is a family-run business based in the town of Guelph, Canada. We specialize in handmade, small-batch boxes of chocolate truffles, luxury chocolate bars, fudge, vegan chocolates and sugar free chocolates.

        </p><p>Established in 2006, we have developed over 30 chocolate truffle recipes with extensive ranges for those with different dietary requirements. We use only natural ingredients and Belgian chocolate which is ethically sourced, with money from sales going back into the cocoa farming communities, building schools and paying fair wages. Our chocolate is also grown sustainably and our chocolate producer is a member of the Rain Forest Alliance. We use environmentally sustainable packaging which can be recycled or is biodegradable.
        </p></t3>

            Chocolate is truly a gift from God. A heavenly delight like none other. It’s pleasurable… sweet, bitter, bitter-sweet, sweet-sour… and a whole multitude of exquisite tastes and varieties to savor. These delicious and irresistible chocolates deserved a special name. The Greek term for cocoa is ‘theobroma’ which literally means, “food of the gods”… which led us to name our brand ‘Manna’.
            
        </p><p>
            
            We are extremely particular in picking only the finest cocoa beans and every single ingredient that goes into the making of our celebrated Homemade Chocolate. We perfect our craft with a fanatical passion, create new flavors and tastes with love and build upon our craft with all our heart.
            
            Our chocolate delights discerning connoisseurs who visit our boutique.
